# Iot-pet-feeder

An automated pet feeder using the Arduino MKR 1010. The system employs a servo-motor to automatically dispense food at regular intervals throughout the day. A HX711 weight sensor is integrated to monitor the food level in the container. To enhance user interaction, a user interface was developed on the Arduino Cloud, enabling remote control and display via the Arduino IoT application.
